# Interactive Stretching Project

This project is an interactive stretching application that guides users through a series of stretches using image detection to ensure proper execution. The application helps users take a break from their daily routine and reduce stress by encouraging them to perform stretches correctly.

## Installation

No dependencies need to be installed to run the program. To start the application, simply open the HTML file in a web browser.

## Usage

To initiate the stretching program, raise your hand in front of the camera. The application will detect your gesture and display the first stretch. Follow the instructions provided on the screen and perform the stretch as described. Once you complete the stretch correctly, a 30-second timer will start. After the timer reaches zero, the program will reset, allowing another user to begin the stretching routine.

## Problem Space

The project aims to address the prevalence of student stress and mental health problems on campus. By encouraging students to take a break and stretch, we believe that this application can help reduce the significance of this issue. Stretching has been shown to have numerous benefits, including reducing stress, improving flexibility, and promoting overall well-being.

## Tasks Addressed

The application addresses the following tasks to help users successfully stretch correctly:

1. Providing instructions for users if they are not properly executing a stretch.
2. Allowing for automated timing for each stretch to ensure proper duration.
3. Providing positive feedback if all the stretches are completed successfully.

## Deployment Environment Constraints

Please note the following constraints when evaluating the system prototype:

1. The accuracy of limb placement assessment may be affected by the presence of surrounding people in the camera's view.
2. Users should stand at a sufficient distance from the camera to ensure proper detection and tracking of their movements.

## Collaboration Record

The team members and their contributions to the prototype are as follows:

- Whitaker: Supported general code development, contributed to sections 1, 2, 3, 4 of the README.
- Peter: Led code development, implemented the WebSocket framework, data calculations, timer, and conditionals.
- Anuj: Responsible for CSS and HTML structuring.
- Joseph: Modulation, testing, and logic implementation.
